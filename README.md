# Cache Memory Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a cache memory system for a Computer Architecture course assignment. The project includes the implementation of various cache replacement policies and the analysis of performance metrics.

## Assignment Overview

The Assignment involves:
- Developing a basic implementation of cache memory in C++.
- Implementing various cache replacement policies: FIFO, LRU, and RANDOM.
- Analyzing performance metrics such as total hits and misses to evaluate the efficiency of the cache design.

## Files Included

- `main.cpp`: The main source code file containing the cache memory implementation.
- `cache.config`: Configuration file for the cache memory setup.
- `cache.access`: File containing access patterns for the cache memory.
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Detailed instructions on how to compile and execute the code.

## Compiling and Executing the Code

1. Open the terminal in the directory where all the files `main.cpp`, `cache.config`, and `cache.access` are located.
2. To compile, run the command: 
   g++ main.cpp
3. To execute, run the command:
   ./a.out
4. The required output will be printed on the screen.

**Note:** All parts of the project as given in the assignment are implemented.
